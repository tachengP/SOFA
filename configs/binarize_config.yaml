# Merged phoneme groups: phonemes in the same group share the same acoustic features
# and will be mapped to a single canonical phoneme (the first one in the group).
# This reduces vocabulary size and helps the model learn shared acoustic features.
# Example:
# merged_phoneme_groups:
#   - [SP, cl]
#   - [yue/a, ja/a, ko/a, zh/a#]
#   - [yue/iy, en/iy, ja/i, ko/i]
